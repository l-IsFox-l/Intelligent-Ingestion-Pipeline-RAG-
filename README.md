# Intelligent-Ingestion-Pipeline-RAG-
It's a practice project to master my skills.

The project presents itself as a RAG system for loading and processing large documents using a task queue. This system will have a backend and front end parts.
Frameworks used:
- FastAPI
- Celery
- LangGraph + Langchain
- PostgreSQL
- Docker

Right now I have working backend where llm can answer based on loaded document

# alembic init -t async backend/alembic
